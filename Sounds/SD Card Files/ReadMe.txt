Sound files need to be numbered sequentially without any missing numbers.
So if you don't need a sound, don't delete it


Sound files:
0000.ad4 - Tardis
0001.ad4 - Theme SOng
0002.ad4 - Exterminate
0003.ad4 - Menu selection
0004.ad4 - not used, not loud enough
0005.ad4 - Button pressed 
0006.ad4 - Soft whistle - plays when menu is started
